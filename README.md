## About the game

This is a Snake-game made in c and NCurses. For those who are not familiar with Snake, check the internet or buy an old Nokia phone to play and see what is is like 

## Why another Snake-Game?

For people to play and also for any feedback anyone has. I made this game to improve my programming skills. As I am still a beginner, there are many things I still need to improve. I am sure tons of programmers started with thse kind of simple games

I am happy with any feedback from other programmers

## Language
-C, with Ncurses

## Requirements

- A basic computer with a Linux or Windows Operating System
- GCC installed

## Installation

The game should compile on Linux and Windows(Trough Cygwin for example)
fire up a terminal and use:

"gcc -o main.exe main.c -lncursesw" for Windows

or

"gcc main main.c -lncursesw" for Linux

If the game does not show properly, try increasing your terminal size. In Windows this is a property option. On Windows 10 it helps to tick "Use Legacy Console"

Tested on Windows 10, as well on pre-Win10 terminals and in linux text mode
